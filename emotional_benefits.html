				<h1>What can you gain EMOTIONALLY from sports and exercise </h1>
				<img src="images/BoysSoccer.jpg" alt="Boys Soccer Team huddle" class="fullWidthImg"/>	
				
				<h2 class="titleBorder borderRed">Teamwork</h2>
				<p>Most Sports require a lot of teamwork and coordination and over time you will build up important life skills such as communication, organization, problem solving, etc.</p>
				
				<h2 class="titleBorder borderBlue">Playing by the rules</h2>
				<p>Playing by the rules is always very harshly taught to anyone who plays sports and cheaters always end up being caught. Playing sports teaches people the importance of rules and laws and the punishments that follow breaking them.</p>
				
				<h2 class="titleBorder borderGreen">Self-Confidence</h2>
				<p>Similar to the mental benefit of raising self-esteem, playing sports raises Self-Confidence not only by the release of endorphins but also by achieving small goals as you play.</p>
				
				<h2 class="titleBorder borderBlack">Controlling Emotions</h2>
				<p>As any good coach will tell you, always try to keep your emotions under control. Playing sports especially when surrounded by good coaches will teach you how to keep your emotions under control</p>
				
				<h2 class="titleBorder borderGray">Teammates</h2>
				<p>It doesn't matter if you play Recreationally, for your school, or even in a club, as long as you play a sport you will be playing with or against kids roughly your age and typically around where you live. It is also not unusual for you to form friendships with these same people seeing as you already have a similar interest as them</p>
